I just love Android. I recently rooted my phone &amp; installed Xposed. Xposed is a framework of modules that install functionalities you would normally get by flashing a ROM. So, for instance you can change the color of the icons in your status bar, or disable the annoying unsafe volume warning, or add a reboot option to the power menu, without flashing a ROM.

<br>

#### Getting Started:

First you need to be rooted. Then you install the [xposed installer app](http://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer). Once installed, open it, tap on&nbsp;"Framework", and tap the "Install/Update".

Once you've done that &amp; granted root access, you're set to start installing modules.

To install a module, tap on "Download" &amp; select from a long list of available modules.

After installing a module, tick the checkbox under the "Module" section to activate it and reboot.

> You should note that not all apps/modules that use the xposed framework are on that list. You can download some modules online. And some apps use xposed to extend their functionality. For example; [Greenify](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oasisfeng.greenify.pro).

The first module I suggest installing is GravityBox ([Jellybean version](http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.ceco.gm2.gravitybox) /&nbsp;[Kitkat version](http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.ceco.kitkat.gravitybox)).

This module lets you tweak almost anything in your ROM. From quick settings, to the volume control to the lock screen. Anything!

I'm not even going to list out all it can do. GravityBox is enough reason to install Xposed. Period.

(**Note:** This is a Nexus 4, still running Stock Android)

Another module I installed was the "[Instagram Downloader](http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.mohammadag.xposedinstagramdownloader)" module, which allows you download photos &amp; videos from instagram.

So, that it. Those are the only two modules I have installed (With GravityBox, you have the functionality of so many modules, combined!).

Go crazy, have fun.
