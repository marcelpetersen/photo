description: My workspace setup - 2014

I got inspired to write this after replying to&nbsp;[this post on Designer News](https://news.layervault.com/stories/12145-every-day-carry). I have a very light setup and I prefer to keep it that way because I move around a lot.

#### Hardware:

I use a [13‚Äù Macbook Pro (Mid 2010)](http://support.apple.com/kb/sp584) which has been my companion for years, &amp; recently upgraded to an SSD hard drive after a disk failure. I use [Microsoft Arc Mouse](http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/arc-mouse) &amp; a [Wacom Bamboo Tablet](http://www.amazon.com/Wacom-Bamboo-Splash-Tablet-CTL471/dp/B0089VGPII/), though, I rarely use the tablet.&nbsp;I backup my files on a [WD My Passport External HD 1TB](http://www.amazon.com/Passport-Portable-External-Drive-Storage/dp/B008R7EXJW/).

#### Software:

I use [Chrome](http://google.com/chrome) for browsing/building websites &amp; the [Keep extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-keep/hmjkmjkepdijhoojdojkdfohbdgmmhki?hl=en) for syncing notes with my phone, [Photoshop/Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud.html) for designing (Looking to transition to [Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) soon), [SketchBookPro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sketchbook-pro-6/id553377898?mt=12) for sketching, [Colorsnapper](http://colorsnapper.com/) for picking colors, [Ember](https://realmacsoftware.com/ember) for collecting inspiration, [Sublime Text](www.sublimetext.com) (with [Flatland Theme](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/flatland)) for coding, [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-macosx.html) for my local dev environment, iTunes/[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) for music, [Airmail](airmailapp.com) for emails, [Skype](http://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-mac/) &amp; [Twitter](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/twitter/id409789998?mt=12) for communicating, &amp; [Simplenote](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simplenote/id692867256?mt=12) for writing.

Basically, that's it. There are some apps I didn't mention but these are the apps I launch almost everyday.

I like to think of this as my 2013 setup because I expect it to change soon. What do you think?

#### Update:

I recently got the [2014 Macbook Air](www.apple.com/macbook-air/) and I'm loving it. Also some part of my workflow has changed so I'll write an updated setup post soon.
