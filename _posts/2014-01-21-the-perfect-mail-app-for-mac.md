title: The perfect mail app for mac

Ever since [Google acquired and ceased development of Sparrow](http://sparrowmailapp.com/), I've been looking for that mail app that would take it's place on my dock.

Sparrow was perfect. It was simple, could connect to [dropbox](dropbox.com) and [CloudApp](www.getcloudapp.com) for file attachments, Facebook for sender image etc.

It didn't do everything a mail app could possibly do, but it did had the right features and worked really well.

Recently, I bought [Airmail](http://airmailapp.com/). Touted [by reviewers to be the Sparrow replacement](http://mac.appstorm.net/reviews/communication-review/airmail-a-real-sparrow-alternative/). At first glance, It looked like it but after installing and using it for a while, I don't think I agree.

What made Sparrow a hit was the simplicity. Airmail looks simple, but really isn't. It has too many features. It wants to do everything, and that's a big problem. It feels buggy &amp; unfinished. For instance, the "preferences" window is a mess. Too much going on.

Anyway, I'm back to Sparrow for now. No future updates, but it's a fair trade-off.&nbsp;
