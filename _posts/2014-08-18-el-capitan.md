description: First Impressions of the OS - OS X El Capitan
---

I recently updated to the OS X Yosemite developer preview on my macbook air and I've been loving it so far. It's smooth and there are only a few bugs. All my software run fine &amp; overall it doesn't feel like a developer preview.

I try my best to look for an efficient way of being more productive. I can get distracted pretty easily so I try to get rid of any distractions and anything that can divert my attention.

#### Launching Apps

I've removed the launchpad from my dock (and disabled the pinch gesture) and strictly use spotlight for launching apps. Viewing all my apps in a grid of icons is too much of a distraction.

I only have the apps I'm working with at the moment on my dock - &amp; I don't have it hidden.

I've also turned off the dashboard. There's a simple way to turn it off in system preferences &gt; Mission control.

#### Applications

I try not to have too many apps installed. Apart from the default Apple apps. I have only a handful of apps installed.

Apps I frequently use include [Sublime text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari),&nbsp;[Ember](http://realmacsoftware.com/ember), [Airmail](http://airmailapp.com/), [Simplenote](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simplenote/id692867256?mt=12), [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/download/mac/), [Colorsnapper](http://colorsnapper.com/), [Adobe Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/product.jsp?product=39&amp;platform=Macintosh) &amp; [Github](https://mac.github.com/).

I also use a few chrome extensions like Google keep which easily syncs notes with my Android device.

#### Hardware

I recently got a 2014 Macbook Air 13" and it's been great. The battery life is awesome and I can say it's the best purchase i've made this year.
