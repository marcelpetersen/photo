Two years ago, I had this simple idea — To post one photo each day, of places I
went to in Lagos. I created a tumblr —
[randomlagos.tumblr.com](http://randomlagos.tumblr.com/) and uploaded random
photos of places in Lagos. The photos weren’t professional or edited, I just
pull out my phone and take a picture — Pretty straightforward.

Fast-forward to today, I opened the blog I hadn’t opened in a while and noticed
how some places in the pictures looked different from how they do today.

I immediately remembered a photo I saw on Twitter, comparing [how Broad Street
looked in 1951 and
Now](https://twitter.com/seemeseenigeria/status/535416498450595840), and I
wondered how these places would look in 60 years.

I also remembered the messages I received on Tumblr from Nigerians outside the
country who had left the country requesting locations where I should take
pictures of. Following the blog showed them what home looked like — without the
fancy lenses & photo filters.

I think this is an idea worth exploring, there’s some value here. I’m thinking
of building on the idea & see where it takes me. I’ve registered the domain name
[randomlagos.com](http://randomlagos.com/).

Please if you have suggestions, I would love to hear them.
