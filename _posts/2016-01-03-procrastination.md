description: How I stop procrastination
---

Just stop! That’s what I tell myself whenever I’m at that point where I seem to
be over-thinking a task at hand. I find myself rethinking, perfecting,
criticizing or polishing what I’m working on, and sometimes starting over just
because it doesn’t look perfect...

Working on a 4th redesign of a product that
hasn’t even seen the light of day. Or Instead of working, spending countless
hours researching on the job.

At the end of the day, I realize that I had been busy but didn’t really
accomplish much.

The simple solution (though not as easy as it sounds) is not holding on for
long. Don’t wait till it’s perfect. Ship it!

I’ve been trying this lately & while I might not have the feeling of contentment
while/after working, in the end it’s worth it.
